git hooks for anaconda development

pre-commit
    Run the runpylint.sh test on the files changed in the commit.

    To use, copy this script to your .git/hooks directory and
    edit the OTHER_MODULES_PATH to point to where you normally have
    pykickstart and blivet checked out. Note that if the current
    working versions of these differ too much the pylint checks may
    fail.

    Set the NOPYLINT= environmental variable while committing to skip
    running pylint. eg.
    NOPYLINT= git commit -a -m "I didn't break it"
